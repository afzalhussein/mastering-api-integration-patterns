# **Module 1: Introduction to API Integration**  
**Objective:** Understand the fundamentals of API integration, deployment models, and API management strategies.  

---

## **Lesson 1.1: Understanding API Deployment Models**  
APIs can be deployed in different environments, each with its own considerations:  

### **1. On-Premises APIs**  
- Hosted within an organizationâ€™s own infrastructure.  
- **Pros:** Full control, high security, compliance with strict regulations.  
- **Cons:** Scalability challenges, maintenance overhead.  
- **Example:** Legacy banking systems.  

### **2. Cloud APIs (SaaS APIs)**  
- Hosted by third-party providers (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure).  
- **Pros:** Scalable, cost-efficient, globally accessible.  
- **Cons:** Dependency on vendor, potential latency.  
- **Example:** Stripe API (payments), Twilio API (SMS).  

### **3. Hybrid APIs**  
- Mix of on-premises and cloud APIs.  
- **Use Case:** Enterprises migrating gradually to the cloud.  
- **Example:** A retail company using cloud-based inventory APIs but keeping customer data on-premises.  

### **Key Consideration:**  
- **Where should your API management layer sit?**  
  - If most APIs are on-premises â†’ On-prem API gateway.  
  - If mostly cloud-based â†’ Cloud API gateway (e.g., AWS API Gateway).

## **Lesson 1.2: Third-Party API Considerations**  
Many businesses rely on external APIs for added functionality (e.g., maps, payments, AI).  

### **1. Pricing Models**  
- **Freemium:** Limited free tier (e.g., Google Maps API).  
- **Pay-per-use:** Charges per API call (e.g., AWS Lambda).  
- **Subscription:** Monthly fee (e.g., Salesforce API).  

### **2. Service-Level Agreements (SLAs)**  
- Guarantees on uptime, response time, and support.  
- **Example:**  
  - SLA of 99.9% = ~9 hours downtime/year.  
  - SLA of 99.5% = ~44 hours downtime/year.  
- **Critical systems need high-SLA APIs!**  

### **3. Direct vs. Managed Integration**  
- **Direct:** Call third-party APIs from your app.  
  - **Risk:** Rate limits, changing APIs break your app.  
- **Managed:** Route through your API gateway.  
  - **Benefit:** Caching, retries, unified logging.

## **Lesson 1.3: API Management Strategies**  
API management tools (e.g., Kong, Apigee) help govern, secure, and monitor APIs.  

### **Key Features:**  
1. **Developer Portals**  
   - Documentation, API key generation.  
   - Example: Stripeâ€™s developer docs.  
2. **Rate Limiting**  
   - Prevent abuse (e.g., 1000 requests/hour per user).  
3. **Security Policies**  
   - OAuth, JWT validation, IP whitelisting.  
4. **Analytics & Monitoring**  
   - Track usage, errors, performance.

## **Hands-on Exercise**  
### **Task:** Compare Two Public APIs  
1. Pick two APIs (e.g., GitHub API & Weather API).  
2. Analyze:  
   - **Deployment model** (cloud/on-prem/hybrid).  
   - **Pricing** (free tier? pay-per-use?).  
   - **SLA** (if documented).  
   - **Integration method** (direct or via gateway?).  

### **Example Submission:**  
| API          | Deployment | Pricing       | SLA    | Integration Method |  
|--------------|------------|---------------|--------|--------------------|  
| GitHub API   | Cloud      | Free + Paid   | 99.9%  | Direct             |  
| OpenWeather  | Cloud      | Freemium      | 99.5%  | Direct             |

## **Key Takeaways**  
âœ… APIs can be **on-premises, cloud, or hybrid**â€”choose based on control vs. scalability needs.  
âœ… **Third-party APIs** require checking **pricing, SLAs, and integration risks**.  
âœ… **API management tools** (like Kong) help secure, monitor, and scale APIs.  

**Next Module:** Weâ€™ll dive into **API error handling and HTTP status codes**!

**Quiz (Self-Check):**  
1. Why would a company choose an on-premises API over a cloud API?  
2. Whatâ€™s the difference between a 99.9% and 99.5% SLA?  
3. Name one benefit of using an API gateway.  

*(Answers: 1. Control/security, 2. 9h vs. 44h downtime/year, 3. Rate limiting/caching.)*
